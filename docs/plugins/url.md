## Installation

This plugin is installed by default. ðŸŽ‰

## Description

This plugin provides the `url` and `htmlUrl` filters to fix the page urls in the
pages and layouts.

## `url` filter

The filter `url` normalize a single path with the location value that you have
configured in `_config.js`. It's useful if your site is in a subdirectory or you
want to generate absolute URLs.

```html
<a href="{{ '/about-us' | url }}">

<!-- Full URL -->
<a href="{{ '/about-us' | url(true) }}">
```

Use the character `~` to use the source file name instead of the final URL. The
plugin automatically will detect the final URL for you. This is useful for
dynamic URLs and updating automatically all links to one page when the URL of
this page changes. For example:

```html
<a href="{{ '~/about-us.md' | url }}">

<!-- Will be converted to -->
<a href="/about-us/">
```

If you don't want to use this filter everywhere, you may be interested in the
[Base path plugin](./base_path.md) {.tip}

## `htmlUrl` filter

This filter is similar to `url` but it works with HTML code: it search and
normalize all URLs found in `href` and `src` attributes:

```yml
---
text: 'Go to <a href="/">Homepage</a>'
---
<div>{{ text | htmlUrl | safe }}</div>
```
