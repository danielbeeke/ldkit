**Lume** is the [Galician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language) word
for _fire_ but also a static site generator for [Deno](https://deno.land/).

It's inspired by other static site generators, such as
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or
[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), but easier to use and configure and much more
flexible.

- It supports **multiple file formats**, like `markdown`, `yaml`, `JavaScript`,
  `typescript`, `jsx` and `nunjucks`, and it's easy to extend with more.
- You can hook **processors** to manipulate `html` and assets, like `css` or
  `js`.
- **It's Deno:** Forget about managing thousands of packages in `node_modules`
  or complex bundlers. Lume only installs what you need. Clean, fast and secure.
